<h2>Three Steps to Upload Your First Dompetitor</h2>
</td></tr>

<tr><td width=400em>

<h3>1) Download and Install a Python Interpreter</h3>
<p>The first step in creating a Dompetitor is to install a Python interpretor -- a program that understands Python and can help you program and debug your code.  Idle is a basic interpreter that comes bundled with a standard Python install.  Download it here:<br /></p>
<table><tr><td><a href='https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.8/'><img src="/images/idle.png" width=100em /></a></td>
<td><a href='https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.8/'>https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.8/</a></td></tr></table>
Once it finishes downloading, follow the necessary steps to install it. 

<p>(Obviously you can use any other interpreter if you have a preference)</p>

<h3>2) Copy the Example Code</h3>
<p>When you open Idle you should see two windows. One called the "Python Shell" and another for writing a new Python file which is probably labeled "Untitled" if you just installed.  If you don't see the second window, open a new file with File>New or File>New Window. </p>

<p>The Python Shell is an interactive window where you can type python phrases and have them immediately interpretted.  This is a great tool for touching up on your Python syntax or running a quick test. Go ahead and mess around with it for a few minutes. </p>

<p> Once you're done playing with the Python shell, open up your other editor window.  Paste in the following code: <span class=example-click>show example</span><br />
<table class=example>
<tr><td>
<pre>
class TheRock:

    def __init__(self):
        # initialize your competitor
        pass

    def process_and_decide(self, state):
        opponents_move = state.get_opponents_last_guess()
        # figure out what you want to do and then
        # return a (move, comment) tuple
        return ("R", "Can you smell what The Rock is cookin'?")
</pre></td></tr></table>
<script type="text/javascript">
    $('.example').hide()
    $('.example-click').on('click',function() {
        $('.example').toggle();
    });
</script></p>

<h3>3) Upload Your File</h3>

Go the the <a href="../cgi-bin/index.py">upload page</a> Click the "Choose File" button, find your file, and then click "Submit". Easy.

<h3>Python</h3>
<p>Currently Dompetition is written in Python and if you want to participate you need to write code in Python -- but if you don't know Python, don't worry.  Python  could be <b><i>the easiest</i></b> language for those new to programming and its quick to pick up for those who already know how to program.</p>
<p>According to "PEP 20 (The Zen of Python)" the core philosophy of Python includes aphorisms such as:
    <ul><li>Beautiful is better than ugly</li>
        <li>Explicit is better than implicit</li>
        <li>Simple is better than complex</li>
        <li>Complex is better than complicated</li>
        <li>Readability counts</li>
    </ul>
